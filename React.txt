React is a Javascript librry for building user interfaces

	Destructuring: Easily extract array elements or objects properties and store them in variables
to create a real copy of the object
	const person = {name:'Max'}
	const secondPerson = {...person}
	person.name = 'Namu'
	console.log(secondPerson)//this prints Max bc we create a copy without reference
Component
	combination of html, javascript and css
React use a Declarative approach

install nodejs
Creating a react project
	cpx create-react-app my-app
	cd my-app
	npm start
	open the project and npm install

jsx
html inside javascript
create components folder
	create the js file
	function ExpenseItem(){
		return <h2> Expense item!</h2>	
	}
	export default ExpenseItem;
	
	in function app add
	import ExpenseItem from './components/ExpenseItem';
	//and add 
	<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
	
Adding styling
	create the file in the components folder
	ExpenseItem.css
	and import the css file inside the js file
	import './ExpenseItem.css';
	use the className attribute

Passing data using Props
	example:
	<ExpenseItem title={expenses[0].title}>	</ExpenseItem>
	in the js file
	function ExpenseItem(props)
	{
		
	}
Questions
Question 1:
Which kind of code do you write when using React.js?
	Declarative javascript code
Question 2:
What is "JSX"?
	It's a special, non-standar syntax wich is enabled in React projects
Question 3:
Why is React all about "Components"?
	Every UI in the end up is made up multiple building blocks (= components), hence it makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combination of 	compoenents"
Question 4:
What does "declarative" mean?
	You define the desired outcome (e.g. a target UI) and let the library (React) figure out the steps.
Question 5:
What is a "React Component"?
	It's a Javascript function wich typically retuns HTML (JSX) code that should be displayed.
Question 6:
How many custom React components must a React app have?
	That's totally up to you
Question 7:
Which statement is correct?
	With React, you build a component tree one root component that's mounted into a DOM node.
Question 8:
What does "component tree" mean?
	It means taht you have a root node wich then has more components nested beaneth it.
Question 9:
How do you pass data between components?
	Via "custom HTML attributes" (better know as "props")
Question 10:
How can you output dynamic data in React components (i.e. in the returned JSX code)?
	you can use single curly braces (opening & closing) with any JS expression between them.
 
State and working with events
to add an event
<button onClick="{() => { console.log("Clicked!")}}">
we need import useState
	import React, {useState} from 'react'';
	inside the main function call useState();
