Connect Angular Router to NgRX


NgRX
is an application state management library for Angular wich uses the principles of Redux and RxJS
to install 
	nom install -s -E @ngrx/store @ngrx/store-devtools @ngrx/effects @ngrx/router-store
create the file app-state.ts inside src/app
and create the file car.actions.ts inside the component (Actiona are for edit, add, delete)
then create the reducers car.reducer.ts 
	reducers produce a new state the method receive  an state and action 
	in app.module.ts
		add import {StoreModule} from '@ngrx/store';
		and we need to import the reducers
		and in the imports 
			imposrt:[
				StoreModule.forRoot({
					cars:carReducer, 
					editCarId:editCraIdReducer
				})
			]
//in the component
	
import {AppState} from '../../app-state';
import {Car} from '../../models/car';
import {appendCar,replaceCar,deleteCar,editCar,cancel} from '../../car.actions'


=====================================================================================
Adding effects
	add car.effects.ts
	and the call the effects file in the module
		import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects' and add it in the imports
		EffectsModule.forRoot([CarEffects])
