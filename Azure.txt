App service
	is the quikest path to publish your web-based projects.
	has been designed with devops in mind
	it support tool for CI/CD including github webhooks,Jenkins, Azure DveOps, TeamCity and others.
	
	When to use
		 when you are migrating existing web applictions to Azure.
		 when you need fully managed hosting platform for your web apps
		 to support mobile clients
		 expose REST API
Azure Virtual Machines
	Infraestructure as a Service
	Deploy or Migrate your application in Windows or Linux
	
	When to use 
	When you want full control in your application structure
	or to migrate on-premises appliation workloads to azure without having to make changes
	
Azure Functions(Serverless)
	Code executions is triggered by HTTP requests, webhooks, cloud service events, or on a schedule.
	You pay only for the time that your code executes.

Azure Service Fabric
	is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to build, package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. 
	It also provides comprehensive application management capabilities for provisioning, deploying, monitoring, upgrading/patching, 
	and deleting deployed applications. 
	Apps, which run on a shared pool of machines, can start small and scale to hundreds or thousands of machines as needed.

	Service Fabric supports WebAPI with Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) and ASP.NET Core. It provides SDKs for building services on Linux in both .NET Core and Java

What is Azure App Service
	A cloud-based web hosting service
Tradicional hosting scenario
	FTP->Web Server(VM) ->Infraestructure =>Internet
						->Database Server
Integrated App service
	Deploy for desktop IDE -> Azure cloud(App services, Database, Dock container)Continuos deployment
App service Features
	Authentication an Authorization
	Application Insights = metris about your app's usage
	Configure backups of your app and its Database
	Set up a custom domain 
	Toggle TLS/SSL settings and use security certifications
	Network configuration to restrict access to your app
	Scale resourse
	Webjobs allows you to run background jobs
	Push notifications to modile clients
	Set up alerts
/************************************************************************************************************************/
Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems:
    Logic Apps
    Microsoft Power Automate
    WebJobs
    Azure Functions

Logic Apps
	Logic Apps is a service within Azure that you can use to automate, orchestrate, 
	and integrate disparate components of a distributed application. 
	By using the design-first approach in Logic Apps, 
	you can draw out complex workflows that model complex business processes

Microsoft Power Automate
	Microsoft Power Automate is a service that you can use to create workflows even when you have no development or IT Pro experience.
WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK
	The Azure App Service is a cloud-based hosting service for web applications, 
	mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs. 
	These applications often need to perform some kind of background task.
	There are two kinds of WebJob:
    	Continuous. These WebJobs run in a continuous loop. 
			For example, you could use a continuous WebJob to check a shared folder for a new photo.
    	Triggered. These WebJobs run when you manually start them or on a schedule.
Azure Functions
	An Azure Function is a simple way for you to run small pieces of code in the cloud, 
	without having to worry about the infrastructure required to host that code

In most cases, the simple administration and more flexible coding model provided by Azure Functions 
may lead you to choose them in preference to WebJobs. However, you may choose WebJobs for the following reasons:
    You want the code to be a part of an existing App Service application and to be managed as part of that application, 
	for example in the same Azure DevOps environment.
    You need close control over the object that listens for events that trigger the code. 
	This object in question is the JobHost class, and you have more flexibility to modify its behavior in WebJobs.
