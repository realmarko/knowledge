JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises
good
	//Constant
	O(1) //the funcion only has a one operation

	//proportional
	O(n) is a diagonal line 1 for cicle

normal
	//divide and conquer
	O(log n) we can divide and conquer, if we are looking for a value we split to a half, and repeat the process until find the number

	O(nlog n) some Sorting Algorithms

Horrible code
	O(2n) an example of this is a for and immediatly another for or more

	//loop within a loop
	O(n2) nested for loops in the graph the line goes to up quickly





Arrays
array.push(17)//adds a new item at the end
array.pop()// removes the last item
array.shift() //removes the firt item in the array and the indexes are fixed
myarray.splice(1,0,'Hi')//add Hi to index 1 and don't remove anything, reordering the indexes


mergesort is one of the best sorting algorithms
selection sort is worst
