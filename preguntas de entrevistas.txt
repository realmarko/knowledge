SQL
	si un store procedure esta muy lento que hago para mejorar su rendimiento
		Use SET NOCOUNT ON
			SQL Server returns informational messages when running select or DML operations. In case a procedure has many such 
			statements a cursor or a while loop SQL Server will display lot of such messages increasing network traffic
		Use fully qualified procedure name
			SQL Server can swiftly find the compiled plan instead of looking for procedure in other schemas when schemaname is not specified
		Use sp_executesql instead of Execute for dynamic queries
			The sp_executesql allows for cache plan reuse and protects from SQL Injection.
		Avoid naming user stored procedure as sp_procedurename.

	WHAT IS CURSOR?
		A SQL cursor is a database object which is used to retrieve data from a result set one row at a time. 
		A SQL cursor is used when the data needs to be updated row by row.

		sp_executesql or execute
	difference between truncate and delete
		TRUNCATE SQL query removes all rows from a table, without logging the individual row deletions.
	
	Difference between store procedure and function
	Stored Procedure:
		A Stored procedure is always used to perform a specific task.
		It can return zero, one or more value.
		It can have both Input and Output Parameters.
		Exception handling can be done using a try-catch block.
		A function can be called from a Procedure.
	Functions:
		Functions must return a single value.
		It can only have the input parameter.
		Exception handling cannot be done using a try-catch block.
		A Stored procedure cannot be called from a function.
	
	DROP
		DROP table query removes one or more table definitions and all data, indexes, triggers, constraints, and permission specifications for those tables.
	what is a function
		we cannot call a store procedure inside a function
		functions have a more rigid structure and support less clauses and functionality.
	what is a store procedure
		we can call a function inside a store procedure
	what is a trigger
		 is a special type of stored procedures that is automatically executed when an event occurs in a specific database server.

What are the locks
Difference between primary key and Unique key
	Primary key will not accept NULL values whereas Unique key can accept one NULL value.
	A table can have only primary key whereas there can be multiple unique key on a table.
	A Clustered index automatically created when a primary key is defined whereas Unique key generates the non-clustered index.

wcf differents contracts
	Service Contract: 	Defines the operations wich are exposed by the service
	Data Contract: 		Defines the datatype of information that will be exchange between the client and the service
	Operation Contract: Are the methods
	Message Contracts: 	When an operation contract required to pass a message as a parameter or return value as a message, 
						the type of this message will be defined as message contract
	Fault Contract: 	defined errors raised by the service, and how the service handle and propagate errors to its clients.

reflection: 
	Ability of inspecting assemblies metadata at runtime
	example of use is when we drag and drop a button in windows forms we can see the properties of that button (thats reflection)
	
	
	what is late binding	
		enables to use code that is not available at compiled time.
	Serialization(como funciona internamente), 
		Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file
		Serialization can be performed in two ways, basic and custom
		Basic serialization
			The only requirement in basic serialization is that the object has the SerializableAttribute attribute applied.
		Custom serialization
			you can specify exactly which objects will be serialized and how it will be done. 
			The class must be marked SerializableAttribute and implement the ISerializable interface.

	CLR
		Manages the execution of the program
		
	What are extension methods
		Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, 
		recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type
		The most common extension methods are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing 
		System.Collections.IEnumerable and System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types
What is boxing and unboxing
	Boxing:is the process of converting a value type to the type object
	Unboxing: extracts the value type from the object.

	Difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable
		The main difference between “IEnumerable” and “IQueryable” is about where the filter logic is executed. 
		One executes on the client side (in memory) and the other executes on the database.
		IEnumerable:It is suitable just for iterate through collection and you can not modify (Add or Remove) data 
			IEnumerable bring ALL data from server to client then filter them, 
			assume that you have a lot of records so IEnumerable puts overhead on your memory.
		IQuerable:Whenever we encounter to huge data with so many records so we have to reduce overhead from application. 
			IQueryable prepares high performance in such situations (huge data) by filtering data firstly and then sending filtered data to client.
				
	Difference between hashtable and dictionary
	Dictionary
		Dictionary is generic type Dictionary<TKey,TValue>
		Dictionary class is a strong type < TKey,TValue > Hence, you must specify the data types for key and value.
		There is no need of boxing/unboxing.
		When you try to access non existing key dictionary, it gives runtime error.
		Dictionary maintains an order of the stored values.
		There is no need of boxing/unboxing, so it is faster than Hashtable.
	Hashtable
		Hashtable is non-generic type.
		Hashtable is a weakly typed data structure, so you can add keys and values of any object type.
		Values need to have boxing/unboxing.
		When you try to access non existing key Hashtable, it gives null values.
		Hashtable never maintains an order of the stored values.
		Hashtable needs boxing/unboxing, so it is slower than Dictionary.
		
que es una clase generica
	Generic is a class which allows the user to define classes and methods with the placeholder
	It helps you in code reuse
	You can create your own generic classes, methods, interfaces and delegates.
what is IOC
	Normally, the flow of the program logic is determined by objects that are bound to one another. 
	With the inversion of control, the flow depends on the defined abstractions to be implemented that is built up during program execution
what is Dependency Injection
	DI is a technique to create a dependency or dependencies outside the class that uses it. 
	The dependencies are injected from the code that calls the class and any information about their creation are kept away from the inside of the class. 
	This is also why DI is an implementation of the Inversion of control (IoC) principle.
	this create an application loosly coupled and testeable components
What is an assembly
	Is a collection of DLL and Exe
What is State Management in ASP.NET
	means maintain the state of the object and we can maintain in Client side and Server side.
	There are two types of assembly
		Private:it is accecible only to the application
		Shared:can be shared by multiple applications. it is install in the GAC
What is Caching?
	Caching means storing data temporarily in the memory so that the application can access the data from the cache 
	instead of looking for its original location.
DataReader vs Data Adapter
	DataReader result in faster access times than a DataAdapter does.
	DataReader provides asynchronous methods BeginexecuteNonQeury, BeginExecuteReader, BeginExecuteXmlReader
	Datareader is not serializable	
What is Dapper
	Dapper is simple/ micro ORM for the .NET world. 
	Dapper was created by StackOverflow team to address their issues and open source it. 
	It's a NuGet library that can be added to any .NET project for database operations.

Async and threads
thread safe
	is a technique which manipulates shared data structure in a manner that guarantees the safe execution of a piece of code 
	by the multiple threads at the same time.
	removes the Race Condition and Deadlocks
	Race condition 
		occurs when two threads access a shared variable at the same time. 
		The first thread reads the variable, and the second thread writes to the same variable at the same time.
		Try to use locks to avoid race condition
	Deadlock
		It is kind of a situation in which two or more competing threads or tasks wait for the other task to finish and they never finish.
