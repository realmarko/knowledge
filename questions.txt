*******************************************************************
Difference between 
arrays, arraylist, list
	array is fixed you can not remove or add
	arrayList is flexible array wich contains a list of objects, if you store value types in it, they are boxed and unboxed that is inneficient
	list leverages generics is a type safe version of ArrayList, there is no boxing and unboxing

Event driven architecture
	is a software design pattern where systems react to changes in state, called events.
	producers and consumer don't directly communicate
	have 3 key components:
	event producers, event routes event consumer
	Azure IoT Hub or Kafka
	there are two topologies
		broker topology	
			there is no central orchestration
			distributed transactions are risky because there is no native way to be restarted or replayed
		Mediator topology
			there is a event mediator that manages and controls the flow of events		
			Maintains the state and manages error handling and restart capabilities
	we need to have a separate error-handler processor, this tries to fix the error and sends back the event to original channel
