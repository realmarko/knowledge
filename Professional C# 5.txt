c#
Common Language
	Runtime (CLR) or the .NET runtime. Code running under the control of the CLR is often termed managed code.
	However, before it can be executed by the CLR, any source code that you develop (in C# or some other
	language) needs to be compiled. Compilation occurs in two steps in .NET:
	1. Compilation of source code to Microsoft Intermediate Language (IL)
JIT
	Instead of compiling the entire application at one time (which could lead to a slow startup time), the JIT
	compiler simply compiles each portion of code as it is called (just in time)
F#
	Is a functional language.
Distinct Value and Reference Types
	Value types - variable directly stores its data
		value types are normally stored on the stack
	Reference types - variable stores the address at which the corresponding data can be found
		Instances of reference types are always stored in an area of memory known as the managed heap
Common Type System (CTS)
	defines the predefined data types available in IL so that all languages that target the .NET Framework can produce compiled code ultimately based on these types.
Garbage Collection
	The garbage collector is .NET’s answer to memory management
	Sometimes, when .NET detects that the managed heap for a given process is becoming full and therefore needs tidying up, it calls the garbage collector.
	It will be called when the CLR decides that it is needed
	Calling the garbage collector in your code is good for testing purposes, but you shouldn’t do this in a normal program
Application domains 
	are designed as a way to separate components without resulting in the performance problems associated with passing data between processes
	If a running application does need to communicate or share data with other applications running in different application domains, 
		it must do so by calling on .NET’s remoting services.
Use of attributes
	The initial idea of an attribute was that it provided extra information concerning some item in the program that could be used by the compiler.
AssEmbLiEs
	An assembly is the logical unit that contains compiled code targeted at the .NET Framework
	Assemblies come in two types: private and shared assemblies
	Private assemblies
		They normally ship with software and are intended to be used only with that software
	shared Assemblies
		Shared assemblies are intended to be common libraries that any other application can use
Reflection
	is access to metadata programatically
nAmEsPACEs
	Namespaces are the way that .NET avoids name clashes between classes
	 is a way to group together associated classes
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) 
	is the newer technology based on vector graphics.
	WPF makes use of XAML in building applications. XAML stands for eXtensible Application Markup Language.
windows services
	A Windows Service (originally called an NT Service) is a program designed to run in the background in Windows NT kernel based operating systems

With static you dont create an object
Variable scope
	The scope of a variable is the region of code from which the variable can be accessed
Constants
	Should be initialized
	you can not initializa a constant using a variable if you want to do that you need to use a field read only insted
Value Types and Reference Types
	Value types are stored in an area known as the stack (bool, long)
	Reference types are stored in an area known as the managed heap (classes, objects, strings)
	If you want to define your own type as a value type, you should declare it as a struct.
Float
	to use a float we need the f letter 
	float f = 12.3F;
Decimal
	decimal d = 12.30M
continue Statement
	The continue statement is similar to break, and must also be used within a for, foreach, while, or do..
	while loop. However, it exits only from the current iteration of the loop, meaning that execution will restart
	at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, rather than outside the loop altogether.	
Namespaces	
	Namespaces are not related to assemblies. It is perfectly acceptable to have different namespaces in the same
	assembly or to define types in the same namespace in different assemblies.
	Defining the namespace hierarchy should be planned out prior to the start of a project. Generally the accepted
	format is CompanyName.ProjectName.SystemSection
	namespace Aliases
		using alias = NamespaceName;

ClAssEs ANd sTRuCTs
	Classes and structs are essentially templates from which you can create objects
	classes are reference types stored in the heap; structs are value types stored on the stack	
	structs don’t support inheritance
	Classes
		Accessibility to the members can be public, protected,internal protected, private, or internal
		data Members(fields, constants, and events)
		Fields are any variables associated with the clas
		Function Members
			are those members that provide some functionality for manipulating the data in the class. 
			They include methods, properties, constructors, finalizers, operators, and indexers.
		Indexers allow your objects to be indexed in the same way as an array or collection
		Constructors are special functions that are called automatically when an object is instantiated.
			They must have the same name as the class to which they belong and cannot have a return type.
			Constructors are useful for initialization.
		Finalizers are similar to constructors but are called when the CLR detects that an object is no
			longer needed. They have the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~)
	To make a property read only we only will use the get
		private string name;
		public string Name
		{
			get
			{
				return name;
			}
		}
	Constructors
		By default if doesnt exists any constructor 1 is created
		If at least one constructor exists then the default constructor is not created
		Static Constructors
			One novel feature of C# is that it is also possible to write a static no-parameter constructor for a class. Such
			a constructor is executed only once
			One reason for writing a static constructor is if your class has some static fields or properties that need to be
				initialized from an external source before the class is first used
	Read only
		Modified in compilation time
		public class DocumentEditor
		{
			public static readonly uint MaxDocuments;
			static DocumentEditor()
			{
				MaxDocuments = DoSomethingToFindOutMaxNumber();
			}
		}
		
	ANoNyMous TyPEs
		is when we use the 'var' keyword
