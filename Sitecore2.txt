Sitecore
in the code views/layouts/sample.cshtml
in sitecore create in sitecore/layout/layouts/Sample Layout and put in the field path => views/layouts/sample.cshtml

with viewrendering 
	I have the view file ex. PageHeader.cshtml
	and in sitecore/layout/renderings I have the same rendering filename


we can put the cshtml of the rendering (PageHeader.cshtml) in the sample.cshtml
using @Html.Sitecore().ViewRendering("/Vies/PageHeader.cshtml")

//dynamic way
@Html.Sitecore().PlaceHolder("content")
add in the sitecore/content/home the rendering 
	PageHeader and set placeholderkey = content
	
ControllerRendering
	We add the class controller in Controllers folder
	and we add the view in views folder
	then we have to create  the controller rendering in sitecore/layout/renderings ex "Page Content"
	and we fill the information in the controller field, controller action
	then we need to add the rendering in Sitecore/content/home in the presentation details section
	
Viewrendering
in the cshtml we can use

	@Model.Item.Name
	@model.Rendering.Item.Name
	@Model.Rendering.Paramaters["Coulor"]
