Parallel asyn programing
Task.Delay
Task.WhenAny<Task>(Task<TResult>,Task<TResult>) //return when the first task is completed useful when we need to see timeout, but is better to use CancellationToken
Task.FromResult //usuful when we have an async method and we convert to a sync method, only work for success results
