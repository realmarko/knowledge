What is S3?
	is a safe place to store your files
	it is Object-based storage
	the data is spread across multiple devices and facilities 
The basics
	S3 is Object-based -i.e. allows you to upload files
	Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	There is unlimited storage.
	Files are stored in Buckets (similar to folder)
	S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
	When you upload a file to S3, you will recieve a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successfull.
	
Data Consistency Model For S3
	Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.
	Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propagate)

S3 is a Simple Key-value store
	S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following:
	key(This is simple the nae of the object)
	Value(This is simply the data, wich is made up of a sequence of bytes)
	Version ID(Important for versioning)
	Metadata(Data about data you are storing)
	Subresources bucket-specific configuration:
		Bucket policies, Access Control Lists,
		Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS)
	Transfer acceleration:is a service that allows accelerate transfer when you are uploading lots
	of files into s3

S3 Storage Tiers/Classes
	S3: 			99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities,
					and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
	S3-IA:			(infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requieres rapid access when needed.
					Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
	S3-One Zone IA: Samw as IA however data is stored in a single Availability Zone only, still 99.999999999% durability.
					Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA.
	Reduce Redundancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
					Used for data that can be recreated if lost, e.g. thumbnails.
	Glacier:		Very cheap, but used for archival only. Optimised for data that is infrequently accessed and it takes
					3-5 hours to restore from Glacier.
					
S3 Charges
	Storage per GB
	Requests(Get, Put, Copy, etc.)
	Storage Management Pricing
		Inventory, Analytics, and Object Tags
	Data Management Pricing
		Data Transferred out of S3
	Transfer Acceleration
		Use of CloudFront to optimize transfers

Securing your buckets
By default, all newly create buckets are PRIVATE
You can set up access control to your buckets using:
	Bucket policies:Applied at a bucket level.
	Access control lists: Applied ta an object level.
S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs, wich log all requests made to the S3 bucket.
These logs can be written to anotther bucket.
